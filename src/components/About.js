      <p>
        As a former healthcare professional, I loved meeting and caring for people from all walks of life, but found that I was
        constantly craving a bigger challenge. When I was introduced to MATLab one day, I gained an immediate appreciation for the scalability
        and endless possibilities that coding offers. I took a leap of faith and decided
        to teach myself programming full-time. Web development allows me to focus in on details in a way
        I've never been able to do before, while bringing out my creative side. As a lover of visual arts,
        I find a lot of joy in creating visually pleasing and responsive apps that have the
        ability to better people’s lives.
